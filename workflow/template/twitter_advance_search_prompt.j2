# Twitter Advanced Search Syntax

When performing Twitter search tasks, you need to understand the specific function of each operator and select appropriate operator combinations based on search objectives. By default, spaces represent AND logic (all words must be included), OR must be uppercase to take effect, and the minus sign (-) is used to exclude specific content.

## Content Overview

Twitter search syntax is a structured set of query rules that allows users to precisely filter tweet content through specific operators. Basic search logic includes:

**Basic Logic Rules:**
- Space = AND - all keywords must appear
- OR = or (must use uppercase letters)
- Minus sign (-) = exclude specified content
- Parentheses () = grouping, used to build complex logic
- Quotation marks ("") = exact match

**Search Scope:**
Search operators apply to Web version, mobile version, and TweetDeck, but not to API searches. Search results do not include private accounts, locked or suspended accounts. Searches can match usernames, screen names, tweet text, and link text.

## Operator Details

### Exact Phrase Matching
Use double quotes around phrases for exact matching. This will search for tweets containing the complete phrase, not scattered words.

**Syntax:** `"complete phrase"`
**Example:** `"state of the art"` will match tweets containing this complete phrase, and will also match hyphenated forms like "state-of-the-art".

### Phrases with Wildcards
Use asterisk (*) as a wildcard within quotes to represent any word. Wildcards can only be used within quotes and must have spaces before and after.

**Syntax:** `"word * word"`
**Example:** `"this is the * time this week"` will match variants like "this is the first time this week", "this is the third time this week", etc.

### Force Original Word Inclusion (Prevent Spell Correction)
Use plus sign (+) to force Twitter to include the original spelling of a word, preventing automatic spell correction.

**Syntax:** `+word`
**Example:** `+radiooooo` will force search for this specific spelling and won't be corrected to "radio".

### Exclude Tweets Containing the Word
Use minus sign (-) to exclude tweets containing specific words. Can be used with words, phrases, and other operators.

**Syntax:** `-word` or `-"phrase"` or `-operator:value`
**Example:** `-love` excludes tweets containing "love", `-"live laugh love"` excludes tweets containing this phrase.

### Search Hashtags
Search for tweets containing specific hashtags. Hashtags must match completely.

**Syntax:** `#tagname`
**Example:** `#tgif` searches for tweets containing this hashtag.

### Search for Links to Specific Domains
Search for tweets containing links to specific domains. Supports full domain and subdomain matching.

**Syntax:** `url:domain`
**Example:** `url:google.com` will match tweets containing Google links, including shortened and full links.
**Note:** Hyphens in domain names need to be replaced with underscores, e.g., `url:t_mobile.com`.

### Filter by Language
Filter based on the detected language of tweets. Language detection is automatically determined based on tweet text and has limited accuracy.

**Syntax:** `lang:language_code`
**Example:** `lang:en` filters English tweets, `lang:zh` filters Chinese tweets, `lang:ja` filters Japanese tweets.

### From Specific Users
Search for tweets published by specific users. Usernames are case-insensitive.

**Syntax:** `from:username`
**Example:** `from:nasa` searches for all tweets published by NASA's official account.

### Replies to Specific Users
Search for tweets replying to specific users. This will show replies from other users to the target user.

**Syntax:** `to:username`
**Example:** `to:nasa` searches for all tweets replying to NASA.

### Mentions of Specific Users
Search for tweets mentioning specific users, including @ mentions and regular text mentions.

**Syntax:** `@username`
**Example:** `@nasa` searches for tweets mentioning NASA. To exclude NASA's own tweets, combine with: `@nasa -from:nasa`.

### Exact Start Time
Set the start time point for searches, including all tweets after that time point.

**Syntax:** `since:YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:SS_timezone`
**Example:** `since:2021-12-31_23:59:59_UTC` searches for tweets after December 31, 2021, 23:59:59 UTC.

### Exact End Time
Set the end time point for searches, excluding tweets at and after that time point.

**Syntax:** `until:YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:SS_timezone`
**Example:** `until:2021-12-31_23:59:59_UTC` searches for tweets before December 31, 2021, 23:59:59 UTC.

### Within Recent Time Range
Search for tweets within a recent specified time range. Supports days, hours, minutes, and seconds as units.

**Syntax:** `within_time:number+unit`
**Time Units:** `d` (days), `h` (hours), `m` (minutes), `s` (seconds)
**Example:** `within_time:2d` searches for tweets within the last 2 days, `within_time:3h` searches for tweets within the last 3 hours.

Your task is to take a user's search query, which may be expressed in natural language, and construct an appropriate Twitter search string using the correct syntax and operators. You should aim to create a search string that accurately captures the user's intent and utilizes the most relevant Twitter search operators.

Here is the user's search query:

<user_query>
{{search_query}}
</user_query>

<current_utc_time>
{{current_utc_time}}
</current_utc_time>

Analyze the user's query and construct a Twitter search string that best represents their search intent. Consider the following:

1. Identify key terms or phrases that should be included in the search.
2. Determine if any specific Twitter search operators (such as from:, to:, @, #, etc.) are applicable.
3. Consider whether to use exact phrase matching with quotation marks.
4. Decide if any terms should be excluded using the minus sign.
5. Evaluate if time-based filters (since:, until:, within_time:) are relevant.
6. Assess whether language filters (lang:) should be applied.
7. Determine if URL filtering (url:) is necessary.

Your final output should be structured as follows:

<constructed_query>
[Insert the constructed Twitter search string here]
</constructed_query>

Remember, your final output should include only the constructed query within <constructed_query> tag. Do not include any other text or tags in your final response.
